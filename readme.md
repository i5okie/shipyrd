# SHIPYRD
### A tool to help with freight shipping

EARLY ALPHA

--

Based on an excel spread sheet I've made at work.
Helps keep track of freaquently shipped items' shipping weights and dimensions.
It knows all the standard shipping crate/pallet sizes, weights, and capacities.
All you have to do is specify the number of items to be shipped, add any custom
made packages (if shipping smaller items with the order).
The total weight is calculated for you.

Initial Objective
* I want to see if creating a 'web-app' is more, or less practical than using Excel document.
* Find out if there is any external interest in the project

#### Completed Work
* none - it's not really an Alpha yet. sooon.


#### Feature vision (does not yet exist):
* ability to calculate volume with an average total height limitation, and recommend a pallet size
* ability to suggest pallet item stacking
